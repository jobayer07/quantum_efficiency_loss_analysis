#Separating the total loss into emitter, base, rear side and antireflection coating

Sunlight has a broad spectrum, ranging from about 300 nm to 1300 nm wavelength. When it falls on a solar cell, part of it is absorbed by the cell, part of it is lost. The total loss can be separated based on the wavelength and the properties of the materials involved. Emitter loss is associated with the shorter wavelengths, whereas loss in the bulk and the rear side is related to the longer wavelength photons. This project calculates the spatial distribution of these losses by calculating pixel by pixel.
